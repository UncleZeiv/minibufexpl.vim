MiniBufExplorer
===============

This is a fork of Bindu Wavell's excellent minibufexpl.vim script, mainly to improve vertical visualization mode.


New features
------------

* option to sort the buffer list alphabetically

* hook for defining custom matching patterns  
  e.g. to color different file types differently

* option to specify how the buffer name is displayed  
  e.g. to allow displaying as a full path

* option to group buffers by directory

* option to only display loaded buffers

* option to perform custom substitutions over directory names  
  e.g. to show the home directory as $HOME

* buffer numbers are aligned in vertical mode

* various other small improvements and bug fixes
